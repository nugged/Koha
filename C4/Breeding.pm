=head1 NAME

C4::Breeding : module to add biblios to import_records via
               the breeding/reservoir API.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Z3950Search($pars, $template);
    ($count, @results) = &BreedingSearch($title,$isbn);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains routines related to Koha's Z39.50 search into
cataloguing reservoir features.

=head2 BreedingSearch

($count, @results) = &BreedingSearch($term);
C<$term> contains the term to search, it will be searched as title,author, or isbn

C<$count> is the number of items in C<@results>. C<@results> is an
array of references-to-hash; the keys are the items from the C<import_records> and
C<import_biblios> tables of the Koha database.

=head2 Z3950Search

Z3950Search($pars, $template);

Parameters for Z3950 search are all passed via the $pars hash. It may contain isbn, title, author, dewey, subject, lccall, controlnumber, stdid, srchany.
Also it should contain an arrayref id that points to a list of id's of the z3950 targets to be queried (see z3950servers table).
This code is used in acqui/z3950_search and cataloging/z3950_search.
The second parameter $template is a Template object. The routine uses this parameter to store the found values into the template.

=head2 Z3950SearchAuth

Z3950SearchAuth($pars, $template);

Parameters for Z3950 search are all passed via the $pars hash. It may contain nameany, namepersonal, namecorp, namemeetingcon,
title, uniform title, subject, subjectsubdiv, srchany.
Also it should contain an arrayref id that points to a list of IDs of the z3950 targets to be queried (see z3950servers table).
This code is used in cataloging/z3950_auth_search.
The second parameter $template is a Template object. The routine uses this parameter to store the found values into the template.
